You wake up to blinding white lights and a blinding headache; slowly pulling yourself up to look around, you see that you're lying on an examination table in the middle of a sterile-looking lab. To your left is a small table holding a golden hourglass. To your right, a counter with two items on it; a futuristic computer, and a strange weapon of unknown origin. Directly in front of you is a door, with light bleeding out from underneath. You get up from the exam table and decide to take a closer look around.
