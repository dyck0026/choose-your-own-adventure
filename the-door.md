You get up from the examination table and walk over the door. Once you get a little closer, you notice that it's already slightly open. You cautiously peer through the crack, but the warm light shining through it is too bright to make anything out. Inching the door open with your hand, the overwhelming smell of earth and plants hits you, along with the even more overwhelming view of a vibrant rainforest sprawling out in front of you. The dappled sunlight shining through the densely leafy canopy warms your face where it falls. You slowly start to walk through the forest, listening to the distant bird song and the rustle of wind through the trees. You look down to step over a large tree root blocking the path, and when you look up, a large structure lays before you. It would look like a shrine, except for the roots and vines covering the white marble. In the center lies a statue of a woman, carved out a material you don't recognize.
